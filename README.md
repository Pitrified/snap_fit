# Snap fit

## Project Overview

Snap Fit is a computer vision project designed to digitize and solve physical jigsaw puzzles. It processes images of puzzle pieces to identify their shapes, contours, and unique features, creating a digital representation of each individual piece.

The system utilizes OpenCV for robust image processing, employing techniques like contour detection and segmentation to isolate pieces from the background. It incorporates calibration methods, such as ArUco markers, to ensure scale invariance and accurate spatial mapping, allowing for precise analysis of piece geometry.

The ultimate goal is to automate the puzzle-solving process by matching piece edges and assembling the full image digitally. By analyzing the morphology of interlocking segments, Snap Fit aims to assist or fully automate the reconstruction of complex puzzles from scattered pieces.
